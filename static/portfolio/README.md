# About this Folder

`SVG` is the preferred format when it comes to source an image on [www.ulynks.io](https://www.ulynks.io/) website.

However we also keep some `PNG` source files for external use, on other platforms that may not accept `SVG` format.

## Naming convention

`brand`-`color`-`shape`-`optional`.`format`

e.g.: `sdu-white-square.svg`

e.g.: `wavelinks-white-square-with-text.svg`

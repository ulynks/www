## Why SVGs?

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) offer versatile and scalable visual elements for web applications and designs. SVGs are resolution-independent, ensuring clear graphics across various devices and screen sizes. These files describe images using mathematical equations, resulting in sharp edges and smooth lines. Moreover, SVGs support interactive elements and animations, enhancing user experiences. Accessibility benefits are also notable, as SVGs can be easily styled with CSS and manipulated using JavaScript. This format's lightweight nature contributes to faster loading times and efficient rendering. In sum, SVGs stand as a powerful choice for creating dynamic and visually appealing content on the web.

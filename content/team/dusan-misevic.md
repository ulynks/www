Flexing new and old data/coding muscles to create web platforms that connect researchers from the Young European Research University Network and beyond.

Still learning, and still benefiting from all I have learned as an evolutionary/computational biologist, computer scientists, system administrator, and director of research affairs.

Scientist, coder, manager, facilitator, mentor, teacher, mediator, communicator, organiser, problem solver, geek.

Strive to be kind, inclusive, compassionate.

Friendly Marine Biologist (Ph.D.) and Data Scientist with a strong background in applied marine biology, eco-immunology, and data analytics. Proficient in python and R programming, I enjoy collaborating on international research projects and working with diverse teams. As a creative maker with a passion for learning, I've developed skills in 3D printing, CAD, laser cutting, and woodwork. Through my data analytics expertise, I aim to uncover valuable insights, enhance internal controls, and optimize efficiency.

Driven by a desire to foster innovation in both academia and industry, I'm proud to contribute to the development of cutting-edge technologies, tools, and techniques. As a dedicated educator and mentor, I find joy in sharing knowledge and promoting the ethical use of technology and data. Currently, I develop web apps and provide support to help researchers obtain funding and cooperation, applying my positive and creative mindset to make a meaningful impact.

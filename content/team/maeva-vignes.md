Member of the Research Support and Policy Team at SDU RIO, my main goal is to support researchers and department research support offices at SDU to get more external funding. I focus mainly on helping to get funding from Europe (H2020 R&I and Societal Challenge pillars).

From my past and ongoing experience I think I can define myself as an interdisciplinary worker with skills coming from sciences, funding strategy, data analysis, engineering, teaching and game development.
